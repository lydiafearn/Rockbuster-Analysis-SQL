This file contains some of the queries I used in order to answer the key business questions for the project.

Query 1 - Films with the highest revenue:

SELECT A.title, SUM(D.amount) AS total_revenue
FROM film A
INNER JOIN inventory B ON A.film_id = B.film_id
INNER JOIN rental C ON B.inventory_id = C.inventory_id
INNER JOIN payment D on C.rental_id = D.rental_id
GROUP BY A.title
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
LIMIT 10

Query 2 - Genres with the highest revenue:

SELECT A.name, SUM(E.amount) AS total_revenue
FROM category A
INNER JOIN film_category B ON A.category_id = B.category_id
INNER JOIN inventory C ON B.film_id = C.film_id
INNER JOIN rental D ON C.inventory_id = D.inventory_id
INNER JOIN payment E on D.rental_id = E.rental_id
GROUP BY A.name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
LIMIT 10

Query 3 - Average Rental Duration by Genre:

SELECT A.name, AVG(C.rental_duration) AS average_rental_duration
FROM category A
INNER JOIN film_category B ON A.category_id = B.category_id
INNER JOIN film C ON B.film_id = C.film_id
GROUP BY name
ORDER BY average_rental_duration DESC

SELECT A.country, SUM(E.amount) AS total_revenue
FROM country A
INNER JOIN city B ON A.country_id = B.country_id
INNER JOIN address C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN customer D ON C.address_id = D.address_id
INNER JOIN payment E ON D.customer_id = E.customer_id
GROUP BY A.country
ORDER by total_revenue DESC

Query 5 - Countries with the most customers:

SELECT D.country, COUNT(customer_id) AS number_of_customers
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D on C.country_id = D.country_id
GROUP BY country
ORDER by COUNT(customer_id) DESC

Query 5 - Top 10 lifetime customers:

SELECT B.first_name, B.last_name, E.country, SUM(A.amount) AS total_spent
FROM payment A

INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id
GROUP BY first_name, last_name, country
ORDER BY total_spent DESC
